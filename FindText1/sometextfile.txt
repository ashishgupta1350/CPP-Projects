I have personally taken up my first C++ foundation course from Prateek Narang sir. I was taught ins and outs of programming with him. That is a major reason why I love coding so much.

I choose coding blocks because:
1) Several of my friends have successfully done courses at your centers including Vikram Singh Bedi, Kapil Gupta(Brother), Anish, Daksh Dobal etc, and they all praise the quality of teaching. They also specially mention the puzzles and question timing and placement as an outstanding factor at Coding Blocks, left out by puzzling complexity and unstructured content of free online tutorials and courses.
2) I want to get exposed to teaching environment, where I need an opportunity to teach the hard learned programming skills at sites like Hackerrank, GeeksForGeeks, CodeChef etc. I know for sure that Coding Blocks will challenge me with everything, I have experienced it my self.
3) I live near Coding Blocks Kohat Enclave center(4Km radius,Sector 8), I will be available any time to code and take doubts. 
4) I worry, taking an intern elsewhere will not polish my programming skills nearly enough.
5) I want to teach and code hard problems, test my self at debugging other's code before landing an intern in a company. I can't think of a better place than Coding Blocks. Coding Blocks has many centers, many many students and great mentors. 

Sir, I just want one opportunity to prove my self. Please let me intern at Coding Blocks Pitampura, I will be the first student to be available at times needed. I have extensive experience in python, Data structures and algorithms in C++. I am including my Linked-In and Github files. I hope it throws light at my skills.
